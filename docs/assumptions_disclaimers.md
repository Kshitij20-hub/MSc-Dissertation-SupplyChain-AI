# Assumptions & Disclaimers (Repository Integrity)

**Provenance:** The dissertation work was completed during **29‑Jan‑2024 → 19‑May‑2024** as part of MSc Advanced Engineering Management (Leeds Beckett University).  
This repository was **reconstructed in September 2025** from the final dissertation and poster to make the work reviewable by employers.  
Where raw artefacts (e.g., supervisor emails, intermediate notes) were private or unavailable, reconstructed summaries are provided.

**What’s original vs reconstructed**
- `docs/Dissertation_77324478.docx` and `docs/Poster_77324478.pptx`: original academic deliverables.
- `docs/progress-log_2024-01-29_to_2024-05-19.md`: reconstructed from diary notes and the dissertation’s timeline.
- `data/weekly_hours.csv`: estimated effort profile for transparency.
- `README.md`, `docs/changelog.md`: created in 2025 to document scope and limitations.

**Method constraints**
- The study uses **secondary case studies** only (no human subjects / no primary data), hence results are interpretive and not statistically generalisable.
- Third‑party figures remain the property of their owners; included here under fair use for academic demonstration.
